Hello and thank you for your contribution!

Due to an excessively long queue of pull requests that have become stale, we are "declaring bankruptcy" and closing all PRs opened before May 1, 2016. If you'd still like to merge this code in, please open a new PR that has been appropriately merged and rebased with the `master` branch.

Going forward, we are committing to review or merge all PRs within three business days so this bankruptcy will not occur again. We apologize for the incovenience and hope you can contribute to DefinitelyTyped in the future.

Thanks
The TypeScript and DefinitelyTyped teams
